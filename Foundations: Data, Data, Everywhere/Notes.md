- The five essential points of Analytical Skills: 
  - Curiosity: wanting to learn something

  - Having a technical mindset: The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way
  - Data Design: How you organize information
  - Data Strategy: The management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis 

- Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem before solving it. Its five key aspects are visualization, strategy, problem-orientation, correlation, and big-picture and detail-oriented thinking.
- A correlation is like a relationship; it does not equal causation.
- Big-picture thinking helps you zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities, while detail-oriented thinking is about figuring out all aspects that will help you execute a plan.
- Root cause: The reason why a problem occurs
- Ask "Why?" five times to reveal root cause
