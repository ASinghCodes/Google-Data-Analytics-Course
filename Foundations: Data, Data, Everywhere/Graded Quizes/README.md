In this folder are my answers for the graded quizes. Given that I am auditing the course I am not allowed to submit the answers without paying for the course, hence there is no way to verify my answers without breaking code of conduct.
Since I refuse to do that, I save my answers to look back on my own understanding later on.


# As of 2/24/2023 when I went to go take my quiz for a section it allowed me to turn it in for a grade. I have not subscribed to the Coursera premium, I do not know why my attempt is actually being graded, but as such I will refrain from taking any more screenshots as now I have access to knowing what are the correct answers to quizzes and capturing such is a breach of code of conduct.
