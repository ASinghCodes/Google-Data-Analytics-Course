- Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed
- Action-oriented questions encourage change
- Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve
- Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied

- Remember: fairness means ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias
