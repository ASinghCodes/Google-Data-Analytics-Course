- Variety of problems, 6 common types:
  - Making Predictions: using data to make an informed decision about how things may be in the future
  - Categorizing Things: Assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
  - Spotting Something Unusual: identifying data that is different from the norm
  - Identifying Themes: Grouping categorized information into broader concepts
  - Discovering Connections: Finding similar challenges faced by different entities and combining data and insights to address them
  - Finding Patterns: Using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again

- Effective questions follow the SMART methodology
  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Action-oriented
  - Relevant
  - Time-bound
  
- Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas
- Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed
- Action-oriented questions encourage change
- Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve
- Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied

- Remember: fairness means ensuring that your questions don't create or reinforce bias

- Data-inspired decision-making explores different data sources to find out what they have in common
- An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed for a specific task.
- Quantitative data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts.
- Qualitative data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color.

- Data starts as a collection of raw facts, until we organize them into individual metrics that represent a single type of data.

- Strategic: focuses on long term goals and strategies at the highest level of metrics
- Operational: short-term performance tracking and intermediate goals
- Analytical: consists of the datasets and the mathematics used in these sets

- When thinking about the benefits and challenges of big data, it helps to think about the 4 Vs: volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.

- A cell reference is a single cell or range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula.
- Absolute references will not change when you copy and paste the formula in a different cell. The cell being referenced is always the same.
- User IFERROR function to handle DIV errors

- A bit redundant topic since you can google and figure out errors with practical use
- A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data.
- Problem domain: the specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem.
- Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.
- A scope of work or SOW is an agreed- upon outline of the work you're going to perform on a project.
